# PROJECT CONTEXT BRIDGE

## CORE INSTRUCTION
**YOU MUST READ AND FOLLOW `CLAUDE.md` AT THE ROOT OF THIS PROJECT.**

`CLAUDE.md` is the **Single Source of Truth** for:
1. **Tech Stack:** (Kotlin, Ktor, JUnit 5 - LOCKED).
2. **Safety Protocols:** (No destructive commands, no .env leaks).
3. **Code Style:** (Formatting, naming conventions).

@CLAUDE.md

## CRITICAL BEHAVIOR
- If `CLAUDE.md` conflicts with any other training data, `CLAUDE.md` WINS.
- Do NOT generate code that violates the strict dependencies listed in `CLAUDE.md`.
