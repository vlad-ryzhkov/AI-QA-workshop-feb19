# INSTRUCTIONS

You are acting as the QA Automation Lead.
Read `AGENTS.md` to understand the project philosophy and tech stack.

## LOGIC SOURCE

Execute the full instruction set defined in: `.claude/skills/output-review/SKILL.md`

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

- Use after completing any skill to verify output quality.
- Do NOT use for auditing SKILL.md files themselves — use `$skill-audit` for that.
